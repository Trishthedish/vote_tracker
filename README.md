# vote_tracker

Currently this project is not fully functional but the thought process that it took to create this is starting to make more sense. I hope to eventually make this functional and remove all of the extra writing below. -Trish


The Assignment for Code Fellows Class Week 3:

Problem domain:

CutestKittenPageant.com has hired you to create an app so visitors can vote on who they think is the cutest kitten ever. The following is a list of requirements they've given you.

When the app loads, randomly select two kitten photos from this album (download these photos, and put them in your project directory).
Ask the visitor to cast their vote by clicking on the photo of the cutest kitten.
After voting, 
Highlight the winning kitten photo.
Increase the total votes for the winning photo by one.
Reveal the popularity of the two photos.
Encourage the visitor to see two new randomly selected kitten photos to vote on.
We'd like you to be in charge of the look-and-feel of the app too. All we ask is that you do the following.
Choose a custom web font.
Choose a custom color palette.
And create a grid-based layout using semantic HTML.
After further analysis, you realize that you'll need the following domain models.

A set of Photo objects to manage all the attributes and behaviors around kitten photos.
A single Tracker object to manage all the attributes and behaviors around a visitor's voting experience.
TIP: First build the HTML structure (planning your grid), then add the CSS styles, and then add the JavaScript behavior. Don't forget to add a README.md describing your approach to this app.

Use jQuery:

You should now be able to replace native DOM function calls in your code with the appropriate jQuery functions calls. Here's a list of native DOM functions that have jQuery equivalents.

getElementById()
getElementsByClassName()
getElementsByTagName()
querySelector()
addEventListener()
createElement()
appendChild()
insertBefore()
removeChild()
Use the JavaScript & jQuery book and the following online references to help you determine the correct jQuery equivalent functions.

jQuery Cheatsheet (Links to an external site.)
jQuery API Documentation (Links to an external site.)
TIP: Remember to wrap your existing JavaScript code with a jQuery ready event handler (Links to an external site.). That way you can move the JavaScript <script> tags from the <body> tag to the <head> tag.
