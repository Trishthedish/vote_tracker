# vote_tracker

This was an assignment from Code Fellows Week 3. The assignment asked us to create from the ground up a simple voting app for the ficticious CutestKittenPageant.com website. This assignment asked to us to use jquery and many of the other skills we've been learning. At this time I can see and truly feel the holes in my current understanding of code. This project took me a tremendous amount of time and its still not functional. I hope to refacture this project possibly this week or even after code fellows. Honestly, I think I'm just fully getting some of the things that we were learning out first week. I hope this is similar in a few weeks. It should be noted that kitten photos are hard added and are not yet cycling through. I mostly put them there to see what it might look like.




List of requirements: When app loads randomly select 2 kitten photos from designated album, highlight winning kitten, increase the total votes for the winning photo by 1, reveal the popularity of the two photos, encouage visitor to see two new randomly selected kitten photos, choose custom font, choose custom color pallete, and create a grid-based layout using semantic html. Additonally, one must create domain model: a set of Photo objects to manage all the attributes and behaviors around kitten photos. A single Tracker object to manage all the attributes and behaviors around a visitor's voting experience. TIP: First build the HTML structure (planning your grid), then add the CSS styles, and then add the JavaScript behavior. Don't forget to add a README.md describing your approach to this app.
